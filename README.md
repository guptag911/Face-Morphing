# Face-Morphing
# Introduction
Here we are trying to apply morphing on two images, in particular, we want to map the changes
from the source image to the destination image. On applying this we can see how pixel values
are converting from source image to destination image. To get better results triangulation is
used to do the region-wise mapping.
